**Bug fixes:**

 * Git branches study improved\
   Previously, while the branches study was running, the `branches` field
   remained empty or partially filled until the study was completed,
   leading to incorrect data being displayed on the dashboard. With this
   change, the branches field is updated only after the study has
   finished.
