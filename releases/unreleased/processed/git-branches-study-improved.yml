title: Git branches study improved
category: fixed
author: null
issue: null
notes: >
    Previously, while the branches study was running,
    the `branches` field remained empty or partially filled
    until the study was completed, leading to incorrect data
    being displayed on the dashboard.
    With this change, the branches field is updated only
    after the study has finished.
