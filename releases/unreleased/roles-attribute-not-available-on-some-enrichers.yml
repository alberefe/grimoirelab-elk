title: Roles attribute not available on some enrichers
category: fixed
author: Santiago Due√±as <sduenas@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
  The 'roles' attribute wasn't available for all the
  enrichers. The attribute has been added to the
  main class 'Enrich' so subclasses will have it
  available even when they don't use it.
