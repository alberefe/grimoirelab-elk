notes: >
  The Bugzilla enriched items include two new
  fields to track response times on these type
  of repositories.
  The field `time_to_first_attention` is the
  the time expressed in days between the ticket
  creation and the first comment from a contributor
  different from the author creating the bug.
  The field `last_comment_date` is the date of
  the last comment posted in the bug.
