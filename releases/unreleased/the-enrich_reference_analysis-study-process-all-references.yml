    The `enrich_reference_analysis` study analyzes the cross-references
    between "issues" and "pull request". When we use an aggregations query,
    it returns only the first 10 items (ElasticSearch/OpenSearch by default).
    By using 'composite aggregations', we can paginate the result and thus,
    obtain all the references.
