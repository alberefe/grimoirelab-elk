## grimoire-elk 1.2.0-rc.1 - (2024-09-20)

**New features:**

 * Status in SUMO enriched index\
   Add the missing status in the SUMO backend. The status could be
   `solved`, `archived`, `locked` or `open`.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Avoid UNDEFINED values in author fields\
   Avoid `-- UNDEFINED --` values for all SortingHat fields when Mordred
   loses connection to the SortingHat server during the enrichment or
   autorefresh execution. It will keep the values of the `name`, `email`,
   `id` and `uuid` fields.
 * Handle OpenSearch page info on pagination\
   In OpenSearch and ElasticSearch < 7.x the page info on pagination is
   different. This will handle both of them.

**Dependencies updateds:**

 * Python minimum version updated\
   Python 3.8 will reach its end of life in October 2024. Python 3.9 is
   the minimum version required by the project.
