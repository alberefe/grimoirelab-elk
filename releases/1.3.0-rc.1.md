## grimoire-elk 1.3.0-rc.1 - (2024-10-14)

**New features:**

 * Keywords data on enriched items\
   Keywords field is included now on the enriched items of bugzilla and
   bugzillarest indices.
 * New reponse times on bugzilla items\
   The Bugzilla enriched items include two new fields to track response
   times on these type of repositories. The field
   `time_to_first_attention` is the the time expressed in days between
   the ticket creation and the first comment from a contributor different
   from the author creating the bug. The field `last_comment_date` is the
   date of the last comment posted in the bug.

**Bug fixes:**

 * All references processed for the reference analysis study\
   The `enrich_reference_analysis` study analyzes the cross-references
   between "issues" and "pull request". When we use an aggregations
   query, it returns only the first 10 items (ElasticSearch/OpenSearch by
   default). By using 'composite aggregations', we can paginate the
   result and thus, obtain all the references.
